A) Move a motor individually in Open Loop during a time

Parameters:

	- Motor Number (0,1).
	- Direction (0 == foreware, 1 == backware).
	- Power (0..100).
	- Time in seconds (0 == indefinitly)
Commando:
	motor/<motor_number>/<motor_direction>/<motor_power>/<movement_time>
Example:
	motor/0/0/50/0 -- Move motor 0 in foreware direction and with 50% power indefinitilly

B) Move the car indefinitally  during certaion time,  in Open Loop, controlling the motor internally.

Parameters:

	- Direction (0 == foreware, 1 == backware).
	- Power (0..100).
	- Time in seconds (0 == indefinitly)
Commando:
	engine/<engine_direction>/<engine_power>/<movement_time>
Example:
	engine/0/50/10 -- Move carin foreware direction and with 50% power during 10 seconds.

C) Change the direction of the car, during certaion time, in Open Loop, controlling the motor internally.

Parameters:

	- Direction (0 == left, 1 == right).
	- Power (0..100).
	- Wheel angle (1,2,3).
	- Time in seconds (0 == indefinitly)
Commando:
	turn/<engine_direction>/<engine_power>/<wheel_angle>/<movement_time>
Example:
	turn/0/50/3/5 -- Turn left with 50% of power and angle 3 during 5 seconds.

D) Twist

Parameters:
	- Direction (0 == left, 1 == right).
	- Power (0..100).
	- Time in seconds (0 == indefinitly)
Commando:
	twist/<engine_direction>/<engine_power>/<movement_time>
Example:
	twist/0/100/1 -- Twist left 100% power during 1 second.
